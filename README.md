# Examples for API and UI tests in Cypress

## Notes

1. The custom scrips for running the tests can be found in **package.json** file
2. Dependencies needed for running the tests: you should have a package manager yarn/npm
3. Before running the tests do: yarn/npm i -> this will install cypress and prettier for ui (note : prettier is just for formatting the code)
